# BookShopManagement
Book Shop Management System is a python based project. With the help of this project you can easily manage a book shop.

Features:-
1. You can see the inventory
2. You can add book to inventory
3. You can buy a book
4. You can exit the program

Logic used:
1. Inventory gets saved everytime when you add book to inventory or when someone buys a book. So, if you exit the program your inventory doesn't get lost.
2. When you add book to inventory, the program first checks whether that book is already in inventory or not. If that book is already in store then it updates the price and quantity of that book in the inventory and if that book is not in inventory then the programs adds that book to the inventory.
3. Whenever someone buys a book, the program will deduct the quantity of that book in the inventory.
4. When you search for a book by providing name of book and the author's name then the program finds the exact book in the inventory and shows you, if the exact book is not there in the inventory the program shows you the books with similar names.
